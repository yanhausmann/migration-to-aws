# migration-to-aws
Exercício final modulo 7

• You work at a development consulting company and have been assigned to a quick project. Your goal is to ensure that the NEW client can have their jewelry website online as fast as possible while meeting the requirements.
• Your boss, very sharp-minded [sagaz], remembered that another project was previously developed by your consulting company for a costume jewelry store of an OLD client, and that this project is very similar to what the NEW client needs.
• The environment of your NEW client has the following characteristics/requirements:
• Infrastructure on AWS
• Datacenter in us-east-1
• Everything must be executed using make

Activities

• Can the project created for the OLD client technically be implemented in the NEW client's environment?
• Which items need to be adjusted? IaC? Docker? Makefile?
• Copy the project from: https://git@github.com/dartanghan/proway-docker/modulo7-iac_tooling
• Adjust the project so it can run in the NEW client's environment
• Aim to use the cheapest and most efficient solution for the client
• There are several engineers working on the same account, you may face some challanges there.

Evaluation criteria:

• Use the cheapest solution: 5%
• Create a pipeline in GitHub Actions: 5%
• Migrate to AWS: 50%
• Enable security: 30%
• Document the solution: 10%
